# Churn Prediction

This is a machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a telecom company using a trained classification model. It includes a GUI-based interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to input customer details and receive churn predictions.

## 🧠 Model Summary

The model is trained using customer information such as:

- Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
- Account Information: Tenure, Contract type, Monthly Charges, etc.
- Services Signed Up: Phone, Internet, Streaming, etc.
- Payment Info: Payment method, paperless billing, etc.

The model uses standard preprocessing (`StandardScaler`) and a trained classifier (e.g., RandomForest, Logistic Regression, etc.) saved as `best_model.pkl`.
